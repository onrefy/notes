# 演讲准备

collect data analyze data arrange data visualize it 

how to **collect the data**? 

in our system, we have the air sensors and humidity sensor to collect the data, we collected it, and we got  raw datas.

we analyzed these raw datas

noticed that plant have its own life cycle period, that period is a day, seem obviously because of the sunlight

if we can collect plant's data of day ,and visualize it, we will get a plant print.

unique for each plant

and the plant print will be our smallest data unit in our system.

we need to **analyze the data**,

but one plant print is not interesting enough 

if we have two plant print, something interesting will happen

we can put them together,

less intersection they have 

they fit each other

tow, but three, four and more?

**modular design box** for these purpose

simply combined together

then we will regard these two plants as one to collect the plants print

**arrange the data**

in every containers, the untilitys of data varies,

so the ways of data arrangement varies, too.

in atonium, data need to be  arranged overallly,

so we calculated how many plant prints of each kind of plant has been collected,

and the researchers can know the main tendency of their research and justify their research if they think the direction is not proper

in lab, data need to be arranged  at the real time,

so the data showed on the screen will be changed immediately if the condition is changed

in talking room, data need to be arrage accurately,

so we list out all the datas we have and researchers can get the exact plant print of every plant.

totally, we different visulization, the essential thing is data which connect our four containers together

我们现在又很多植物，我们将学生的小组活动的过程分为两个阶段

测量每株植物的数据，得到每株植物的状态频谱图

将不同的植物进行组合，尝试得到更加平衡的频谱图

不断迭代其所得到的数据，从而尝试得到更多植物更加平衡的系统

同样的数据再不同的集装箱内又不同的作用，决定了我们数据可视化采用不同的形式：

实验室：测量数据；可视化偏重实时数据的显示，同时会显示组合前的植物的频谱图。

展览室：总体把握数据；可视化片中对全部的收集数据整体化的呈现，按照每种植物的数据量进行可视化，根据此图可以把控目前研究的大体趋势。

讨论区：对数据的具体分析；可视化片中让学生得到具体的数据，所以在这里片中的是具体的每一个数据的得到和分析。
