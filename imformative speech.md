Game now is a widely-discussed topic in our life. News like teenagers addicted to various kinds of game wasting their family money is occasionally exposed to us and arouse an intense debate among all the generations.

And the attitudes of people towards game can breifly be divided into four classes: those who regard game as something totally useless ; those who get indulged in games and claim the innocence of games;  and those who treat game as a kind of rest; and those who believe game is the mirror of reality.

Many parents have a strong belief that game has no benefit to people. There are two main reason which cause many parents stongly agianst games. First, most of them have experienced the situation when the people around them get indulged in game and pay no time to their study and job. However, another reason most parents can hardly realize is that they actually are not familiar with game.

Young people can  easily get addicted to game. Unfortunately these gamers devote themselves industriously into a single number which represent their level, a virtual character who will never say no to them or an illusory of conquering the non-exsistent enemy.  For them, decipiline in one form or another is the most helpful path.

and for the third class who regard game as some kind of rest, can really balance the life in game and reality. For them game is merely an alternative outlook from their daily boring life. 

However in my opinion, game is no longer only a kind of rest, game is much more like a mirror of our reality. To some extend, during the game process, our characterictic, our values, our ways of doing thing can be reflected . For example in the game sekiro, the core design of this game is an extremely high-level difficulty. At first, you will suffer from the unbearable game difficulty level. But as soon as you overcome all the barriers in this game you will gain a sense of accomplishment which seems to reward all the pain you have suffered. Meanwhile you will be obessed by the game story just like in reality when you are old, you have overcame countless difficulites, and you look back to your life you find the world you has fought for is so beautiful and meaningful.  In this case, game teaches us the reason why we need to fight for our daily life, even if at last we have nothing at all.
