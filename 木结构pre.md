# 木结构pre

## 1

### 初始概念：

旋转和人的交互，形状会随着人的推动进行改变

img：图片旋转+人的概念草图

### 初始建模逻辑：

利用函数去调整木条的长度和角度

函数分析图

### 初始的工艺逻辑

轴承和铁棒

淘宝上的轴承和铁棒

### 问题

1. 形态上：过于单一
2. 结构上：如何让轴竖立起来成为了最大的问题

### 中间概念：

利用多个旋转轴进行大小和位置上的差异来让整体显得更加具有层次感和丰富度

多个的剖面图/侧视图

### 建模逻辑：

调整不同的木条的参数来构造出不同的形状

多个函数分析图

### 工艺逻辑

将各部分组件进行固定之后利用自身的结构来支撑

堆叠-瓦片

### 问题

如果能够自身支撑优雅，然而并不可以，自身的支撑有问题

### 工艺

使用间架来给结构提供支撑点

黄金三角

### 拥有条件：

1. 一个结构来提供大致的形态

2. 每个单元：

   * 角度
   * 长度

   共同组成了每个单元的形状

3. 每个单元的间距

给予了我们的大量的自由度去制作



## 最终概念：

鹏鲲《庄子》

扶摇直上九万里

## 空间分析

1. 下面躺人
2. 旁边坐人
3. 空间有疏密的变化



# 扶摇





Hello everyone, we are the team named done which means we are a team hoping to finish thing quickly, and actually done can also be splitted into do one which means we are a team hoping to do thing with one heart.

Our structure's name is Kun Peng,  which comes from an ancient passage from zhuangzi called A Happy Excursion

in the passage, Zhuangzi described a huge creature which can switch its shape between fish and bird.

when it is in the form of bird, it is called peng.when it is in the form of fish, it is called kun.

 in this passage, this creature is refferred to freedom and elegance.

and if we may summary our work in one sentence

we will say our work is try to picture the scene when the kunpeng is converting from kun to peng.



looking back to our design process, we can mainly devide it into three stages, and in every stage we have a different structure.

On our first stage, our key concept is spinning. At first, we planned to make a structure which every different part could rotate with the collision of passers-by and also, the shape of our structure could change too. So we used computer to get this work done, we used the functions to change the length of both sides and the angle of each assembly. But soon we found it is too difficult to put this structure into vertical, and also the shape turned out to be monotonous

so we came to our second stage, we put it into horizontal, and we increased the number of our spiral, and because we used functions to control our spirals' shapes, it was easy for us to change the shape of our every spiral by changing the function. in this process we actually constructed many different spiral's shapes and we actually build them up together in the software. The shape is more elegant and beautiful, however we doubt the stability of the structure. 

so here comes our last stage, we use a skeleton to hold our spirals, to make the skeleton elegant and stable we use the golden triangle. at the same time our concept of building something like a creature came into our mind. actually at the beginning we had already defined our structure as something legacy, so the kunpeng concept from zhuangzi came into our head and we thought it was a perfect instruction for our shape, if we regard our structure as a song, and we actually had already got different notes for our song, we got some note like wings of birds, some note like the tail of fishs and so on.Now we can see what we have, Golden triangle skeleton, different shapes spirals, and a concenpt of lecacy creature of zhuangzi, everything for us seem so natrual. Combine these things together, we are done! 

and actually we came across few obstacles when we are building, one thing is that our skeleton wasn't stable as we thought at the beginning because there is no triangle from this side, so we add a cross connection for our skeleton and the problem was fixed.

last we want our work has some realistic function so actually one part is for sitting inside the pengkun's stomach

this is our little baby kunpeng and we hope it can bring this world more happiness and that is all thank you!
