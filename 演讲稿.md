甘地传，甘地国会演讲

Since I returned from South Africa, I have traveled over much of India. And I know that I could travel for many more years and still only see a small part of her. And yet, I already know that what we say here means nothing to the masses of our country. Here, we make speeches for each other, and those English liberal magazines that may grant us a few lines.

But the people of India are untouched. Their politics are confined to bread and salt. Illiterate they may be, but they're not blind. They see no reason to give their loyalty to rich and powerful men who simply want to take over the role of the British in the name of "freedom."

This Congress tells the world it represents India. My brothers, India is 700,000 villages, not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi and Bombay.

Until we stand in the fields with the millions that toil each day under the hot sun, we will not represent India -- nor will we ever be able to challenge the British as one nation.

自我介绍

介绍自己的基本信息：

Hello everyone! I'm zhangyize, a boy majoring in industrial design, and this is my third years in univesity.

In my 20-years life, two concepts have deeply affected me.One is science, the other is emphathy.

I am not a scientist, but I believe that anything in this world can be deconstructed in the way of scientism. In this blief, I am interested in many kinds of science such as computer science and psychology.

However, only with the language of scince, we can not describe the whole world, because we need to communiacte with each other. Therefore, we need empathy, which is the way of understanding others in their shoes.

And in this English speech class, I hope to learn the science to persuade others and to increase my capability to emphasize with others.
